          <p>
            I like to stay updated on the latest data breaches, and hacker news
            by listening to Cybersecurity Podcasts, and Reddit. I continue
            learning and keep my skills sharp by using sites such as TryHackMe,
            Hack The Box, Udemy, and Youtube along with some "Google-Fu."

          <h3>Education/Certificates</h3>
          <p>
            I attended Sinclair Community College for a degree in Secure System
            Administration. I got a job while still attending school and have
            been in the I.T. field for 4 years now. The field that got me
            interested in attending school in the first place is Cybersecurity.
            I hold a certification in Linux Security and Networking Essentials
            from Sinclair. I carried a 3.4 to 4.0 GPA while in school and was
            selected for a scholarship for STEM students after submitting an
            essay detailing my degree and why I chose it.

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            My biggest hobby is gaming, it's something I have done since I was
            old enough to hold a controller on the original NES. Listening to
            Music, History Documentaries, a good Stout or Bourbon, and
            walking/hiking in parks with my wife and our dog are some ways I
            like to relax after work.
