          I made this page as a portfolio and to test anything I might be
          interested in. I will be adding to it periodically. I may even add a
          blog to this site eventually. This site will always be a work in
          progress.

          <h3>Education/Certificates</h3>
          <p>
            My areas of study are System Administration, and Web Development. I
            hold a certification in Linux Security and Networking Essentials. I
            love technology, especially seeing what everyone else is working on
            and I love anything open source and completely support that cause.

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            I love playing video games to decrompress after a long day. it's
            something I have done since I was old enough to hold a controller. I
            also enjoy reading a good book, a good glass of bourbon, a good
            stout, or watching documentaries. I love learning and would consider
            myself a history buff.
