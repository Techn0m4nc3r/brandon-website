          <p>
            I like to stay updated on the latest data breaches and hacker news
            by listening to Cybersecurity Podcasts and Reddit. I continue
            learning and keep my skills sharp by using sites such as TryHackMe,
            Hack The Box, Udemy, and Youtube, along with some "Google-Fu."

          <h3>Education/Certificates</h3>
          <p>
       I was selected for a scholarship offered to STEM students, while attending Sinclair Community College for a degree in Secure System Administration.  I've always been interested in Cybersecurity and am continuing to learn and develop my skills. I received a certificate from Sinclair for Linux Security and Networking Essentials, where I also carried a 3.4-4.0 GPA. I was offered a job in the I.T. field as I was pursuing my degree, and I have been in IT ever since.

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            Like most computer nerds, one of my biggest hobbies is gaming, listening to music, history documentaries, a good Stout or glass of Bourbon, and walking/hiking in parks with my wife and our dog are some ways I like to relax after work.
